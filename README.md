# Titanic Dataset Visualization with Power BI

This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using Power BI with the famous Titanic dataset. The visualizations help analyze and understand patterns in passenger data without requiring any programming knowledge.

## Project Overview

This repository contains various Power BI visualizations of the Titanic dataset, showcasing different aspects of the passenger information and survival statistics.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualization plots:
- Basic passenger statistics
- Survival rate analysis
- Demographic breakdowns
- Passenger class distribution
- Port of embarkation analysis

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Titanic Dataset

## Getting Started

1. Download and install Power BI Desktop
2. Clone this repository
3. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop
4. Explore the visualizations and interact with the data

# Titanic Dataset Plot Analysis

## Plot 1 (TITANIC DAX1.png)
- Key metrics displayed using cards and gauge visualizations
- Shows total passenger count, survival rate, and death rate
- Includes a pie chart breaking down passenger classes
- Features interactive slicers for filtering by class and sex

## Plot 2 (Titanic plot 2.png)
- Focuses on survival analysis based on passenger class
- Bar chart comparing survival rates across different classes
- Stacked column chart showing gender distribution per class
- Includes age group analysis with survival correlation

## Plot 3 (Titanic plot 3.png)
- Detailed fare analysis across passenger classes
- Box and whisker plot showing fare distribution
- Average fare comparison between survivors and non-survivors
- Scatter plot correlating fare amounts with survival probability

## Plot 4 (Titanic plot4.png)
- Family relationship analysis dashboard
- Visualization of sibling/spouse counts
- Parent/child relationship distribution
- Impact of family size on survival rates
- Tree map showing family group sizes

## Plot 5 (Titanic plot5.png)
